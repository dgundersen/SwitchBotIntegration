# SwitchBotIntegration
Integrating the SwitchBotAPI to control devices.

## The Inspiration

I work remotely and have a light on my desk that I turn on to let my family know when I'm on a call for work.  The problem is that I have to stand up to reach the light.

I purchased a SwitchBot and wrote this small application so that I can turn on the light by running a script.

Today: Not having to stand.  Tomorrow: Who knows?...
